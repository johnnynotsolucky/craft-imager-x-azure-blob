# Imager X Storage Driver for Microsoft Azure blob

This is an external storage driver for Imager X that uploads your Imager transforms to Microsoft Azure's blob storage.

## Requirements

This plugin requires Craft CMS 3.3.0 or later, and Imager X 3.0 or later. External storages are only available in the Pro edition of Imager.

## Installation

To install the plugin, follow these instructions:

1. Install with composer via `composer require paragonn/craft-imager-x-azure-blob` from your project directory.
2. Install the plugin in the Craft Control Panel under Settings > Plugins, or from the command line via `./craft install/plugin craft-imager-x-azure-blob`.

## Configuration

Configure the storage driver by adding new key named `azure` to the `storagesConfig` config setting in your **imager-x.php config file**, with the following configuration:

    'storageConfig' => [
        'azure' => [
            'endpoint' => '',
            'accessKey' => '',
            'secretAccessKey' => '',
            'region' => '',
            'bucket' => '',
            'folder' => '',
            'requestHeaders' => array(),
        ]
    ],

Enable the storage driver by adding the key `azure` to Imager's `storages` config setting:

    'storages' => ['azure'],

Here's an example config, note that the endpoint has to be a complete URL with scheme, and as always you need to make sure that `imagerUrl` is pointed to the right location:

    'imagerUrl' => 'https://foo.blob.core.windows.net/site/imager/',
    'storages' => ['azure'],
    'storageConfig' => [
        'azure'  => [
            'endpoint' => 'https://foo.blob.core.windows.net/site/',
            'connectionString' => 'MY_CONNECTION_STRING',
            'container' => 'MY_CONTAINER',
            'folder' => 'imager',
            'requestHeaders' => array(),
        ]
    ],

Also remember to always empty your Imager transforms cache when adding or removing external storages, as the transforms won't be uploaded if the transform already exists in the cache.
